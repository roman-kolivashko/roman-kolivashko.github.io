### Huh? What is it?
My personal website where you can learn more about me and see projects I am currently working on, through an awesome bash command.
I wanted it to run on my gitHub so I had to make it all client based. Yup, no server side scripts used.

> Some awesome screenshots coming soon!

### Why?
Personal websites that are portfolios feel and look the same from what I have found. I thought why not make a bash portfolio website! Then you can feel like a techy whilst browsing it and who doesn't like a good bash terminal?

### That's cool, but how?
#### Launguages
HTML, Javascript, Jquery, CSS

#### File Management
Javascript is used to create a <i>virtual file system</i> from arrays containing file names and pointers.

This is all stored on a seperate file, <i>fileManager.js</i>
