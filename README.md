### Huh? What is it?
My personal website where you can learn more about me and see projects I am currently working on, through an awsome bash command.
I wanted it to run on my gitHub so I had to make it all client based. Yup, no server side scripts were used.

### Why?
Personal websites that are portfolios feel and look the same from what I have found. I thought why not make a bash portfolio website! Then you can feel like a techy whilst browsing it and who doesn't like a good bash terminal?

### That's cool but how?
I used simple html, javascript, jquery and a bit of css.
